Movie Recommendation System
There are three functions in the main file: the main, mainMenu and movieDatabase.When mainMenu and movieDatabase are called they display the menus after which they are named. The main function is mainly comprised of a do while loop. The loop is broken out of, and the program is exited when the user inputs 0 when prompted by the mainMenu.Other than exiting the program, the user has 4 other choices: 

The first choice is registering a new user. In this option, when the user enters their name, the name needs to be compared to the names in the file given to ensure that they are no matches. To be able to do this comparison, the program reads the given file line by line and makes a copy of each line. I made a copy because the file has numbers besides the names, and I wanted to be able to compare just the strings against the variable “name”. So, when I make a copy, I truncate the line that I copy so I only have a string to compare to “name”. All of this is done inside two while loops. The outer most loop runs as long as “b1” is true. The innermost loop runs as long as the file is being read. When “name” finds a match, “b1” is set to true, the user is prompted to enter another name, the file is rewound, and the innermost loop is broken out of so that the new name that the user input can be compared to all the names in the file from the beginning. On the other hand, every time a line in the file is analysed and the string does not match “name”, b1 is set to false and if the whole file is read and b1 is still false, then the program breaks out of the loops and can register the new user using the name that was input. In addition to adding a new user to the file user_data.txt, I also add an array to the user_ratings.txt file corresponding to this new added user.

 The second choice is straightforward: movieDatabase() is called.

For the third choice, before even starting the do while loop, I created a dynamically allocated 2D array (arr) which holds float values that are in the “user_ratings” file. Inside the do while loop, theprogram prompts the user for their name. It then goes through the mechanism of comparing “name” to the names in “user_data.txt”. The main difference this time is there is a counter “count1” that increments each time the loop iterates, which will be useful later. When no match is found for “name” in the file, the program brings the user back to the main menu by “continuing” the do while loop. Once the user has entered a valid name, movie index and rating, the rating is updated in the array “arr”. This is done by using “count1” and the movie’s index to access the address at which we want to update the rating. I then overwrite the “user_ratings” file with the updated “arr” array.

For the fourth choice, again before starting the do while loop, the contents of “movie_database” file are put into an array “movie_dtbs”. In addition, an array to hold the recommended average ratings “sums” is created. Inside the do while loop, the program prompts the user for their name and goes through the same verification process as in case 3. The program then calculates the average ratings by the other users by adding the ratings of all the users at the same columns. This is done in three nested for loops.  In the loops, I ensured not to include the user’s ratings in the calculation by using “count4” to skip the user’s index (for arr) in the second innermost for loop when adding the “arr” values. These values are then stored in the “sum” array. To insure that the user gets only recommended movies they haven’t already watched, I created another array that only prints recommendations for movies the user has not yet rated.
